Fastest Path: Way-Point System -OR- Safe Area Mapping:
    Way-Point System:
        Pros:
            Quick computation time
            Easy to get from point to point
        Cons:
            Fixed destinations
            Doesnt scale well, more way points that must be connected.
            Very bot like unless there are macros for how to get between way points
            Difficult to setup
    Safe Area Mapping:
        Pros:
            Easy to setup
            Any destination
            Easy changed
            Can add random movement
        Cons:
            Long computation time
            Difficult to calculate point to point
            Cannot handle moving between zones easily
            Due to every pixel being a 'node', the angle of travel is very difficult to make human like
                because it wants to go from node to node, the angle cannot be smaller than 45 degrees
    Decision:
        Need a combo of the two because the safe area mapping cannot handle moving between zones.
        Zone maps will be safe paths because they provide the most flexibility and are easy to update.
        Zone gates will be way points so that flight paths, the tram, and zeppelins can be handled.
    Notes:
        Dun Morogh is a decent starting place due to the city gate, two gates that lead to the same zone,
        and an instance gate.

Player Facing Direction: Machine Learning -OR- Computer Vision
    Machine Learning:
        Pros:
            Can be very accurate, Id guess +- 5 degrees
            Handles different backgrounds well
            Potentially quick computation time
            Can always improve with more data
        Cons:
            Low resolution but can be improved with more data and outputs
            Tedious data entry
    Computer Vision:
        Pros:
            Very little setup
        Cons:
            Potentially long computation time
            Doesn't handle different color backgrounds well
            Accurate to +- 15 degrees

Player Coordinates: Minimap difference -OR- World Map location -OR- Coords addon with text recognition
    Minimap Difference:
        Pros:
            Doesn't require the world map to be opened
        Cons:
            No feedback unless the whole map is mapped
            Very difficult
    World Map Location:
        Pros:
            Absolute accuracy
        Cons:
            Have to open the world map every time
    Coords addon with text recognition:
        Pros:
            Dont have to open the world map if they are on the screen somewhere
            Absolutely accurate
            Learn text recognition
        Cons:
            Must install an addon (oh, noes)

Custom Addon: Player direction and coords
    I'm thinking this will make this a thousand times easier because I wont have to use clever
    tactics in order to get those and its un-intrusive.
